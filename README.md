Skeleton Cookbook
=================

This is a testable skeleton cookbook designed for you or your organization to
fork and modify appropriately. The cookbook comes with everything you need to

`TESTING.md` to learn more.

(While you're encouraged to customize everything in this cookbook to fit your
needs, I recommend keeping the `TESTING.md` file as-is.)
