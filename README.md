Testing

The cookbook comes with some testing facilities allowing you to iterate quickly
on cookbook changes.

## Rake

You can execute the tests with [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org). The `Rakefile`
provides the following tasks:

    $ rake -T
    rake chefspec    # Run ChefSpec examples
    rake foodcritic  # Run Foodcritic lint checks
    rake knife       # Run knife cookbook test
    rake test        # Run all tests

## Bundler

If you prefer to let [Bundler](http://gembundler.com) install all required gems
(you should), run the tests this way:

    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rake test

## Berkshelf

[Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com) is used to set up the cookbook and its
dependencies (as defined in `Berksfile`) prior to testing with Rake and Vagrant.

## Vagrant

With [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com), you can spin up a virtual machine and run
your cookbook inside it via Chef Solo.

This command will boot and provision the VM as specified in the `Vagrantfile`:

    $ bundle exec vagrant up

(Berkshelf's Vagrant plugin will make your cookbook and its dependencies
automatically available to Vagrant when creating or provisioning a VM.)

## Travis CI

The cookbook includes a configuration for [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) that
will run `rake test` each time changes are pushed to GitHub. Simply enable Travis
for your GitHub repository to get free continuous integration.
